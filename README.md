> How do you like to go up in a swing,  
> Up in the air so blue?  
> Oh, I do not think it the pleasantest thing  
> Ever a child can do!

Robert Louis Stevenson, ["The Swing"](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Swing), _A Child's Garden of Verses_ (1885)

This is a prototype using Pygame of a puzzle platformer that I plan to port to the NES once it's done. It stars a character who compensates for his lack of lower limbs by carrying a grappling hook and using it to swing from whatever object is above him.

Installation
------------
To prepare, install Python 3.6 and Pygame. Under Windows, for
example, once you have installed Python, you can install Pygame with
the following commands at a command prompt:

    py -m pip install --upgrade pip
    py -m pip install pygame

Then run the file `wbb.py`.

Full usage instructions are in `how.html`.
